harmony is easicr 11 execution. Moreover close harmony
could not be well employed in melodies arranged 111 four
s mixed voices We would advise young organists 11 accus·
tom themselves to this method of disposing their chords.
'n is a study that will be found full 11 interest3 and they
will be amply rewarded 111 the time spent in serioasly
preparing accompaniments by the sensible progress tlrey “
will have made and the familiarity thcy will acquire
with genuine Organ music. In Charches where there 111
two urgens, (grand organ and choir orgen), we mean
the accompaniments to be· played on the grand organ, ’
as it' alone can impart that vigour and richness 11 har·
mony which the singing of large messes of people demands,

One word ont the rests. On this subject we wrote
in our hlanual: “Their velue rs one beat 11 the measure.
“lf these pauses, 11111111111111111111111, 1111111 observed‚
“the melodies lose a great deal 11 their charm; they 111
“necessary moreover to secure a good 1111111111, especially
“in congregational singingy or with a very large number
“of choristers'' We have marked them in the accom-
paniments by a short bar crossing three lines of the
stave. The organist 11 these rests may hold down the «-
fundamental note, giving up the other notes of the chord.
But we prefer absolute silence, and that all the notes
even the fundamental one 11 the chord should be aban·
doncd. [n the Plain Chant accompanimentS‚ the rests are
indicated by bars crossing the entire stave3 the little bars
are only marks 11 respiration.
